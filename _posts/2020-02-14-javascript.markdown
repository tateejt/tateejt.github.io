Learning JavaScript has been an exciting rollercoaster, going from Ruby on Rails to javascript was a bit of a learning curve but once I got down the basics I started to understand the concept of writing javascript. Once I started to write and read within the lessons, I realized that it was all kind of the same in a different syntax. Javascript is a very powerful language and can create many different design aspects to your web app. While going thorugh the lessons it was easy because I had learned javascript briefly before. But, also during certain parts of the lesson I would be reading and it would be the same as Ruby on Rails just the syntax would be different. This section has been great and a great way for me to versitile, and be able to learn multiple languages to be what I would call "coachable" and as well be a fast learner.
