As I began working on my CLI Application project. I came into a bump in the road right off the bat. I began to think, "What do I want to write about?" I was not sure at first and I watched the CLI walkthrough video to get an idea of how I wanted to start this project. I knew I wanted to do something with sports or music or just news articles. I began looking for articles on the web, and found this medical news article site. It seemed interesting to me, so I dug deeper into if I could scrape this website and if it was going to be challenging or if it was striaght forward. I kept diging around and once I knew that this webite was a good one to scrape I began to code, and stratigize. I first build out my my different files and directory in the CMD. I wrote my bin folder which I knew was going to run my code. I then built my lib folder which I knew was going to hold my hard code which would make my application. After I had built out my different files, I had run into a few problems while scraping. The website had had different class names in the article with the details about the article. So, I had to figure out a way, depending on the articles class name, get my code to read the details and display the article. Once I figured that out I only had to finish putting together my README file and push my commits to github. This project was a great first one for me, I learned a lot about scraping and how it can be useful. I ran to a lot of challenges and some awesome victories.
