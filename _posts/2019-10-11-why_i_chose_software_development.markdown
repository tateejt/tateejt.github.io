I decided to become a software developer in high school, where I took an engineering class. This class contained building things with your hands to programming a remote to control a robot. Everything about this class made me fall in love with engineering. That was when I decided that engineering was the path for me. I then began to do research and at the time I did not know that there were different fields within engineering. From Mechanical to computer to civil and so on. Ever since I was in elementry school I knew that I wanted to do something with computers, although I was not sure what exactly until high school. Fast forward to a month ago, where I found this program and began to talk to the school about attending there software class. Which is were we are now, I hope to obtain enough of the information to land a full time job. To then start my career as a software engineer.
