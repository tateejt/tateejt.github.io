Wow! I made it. This was a great and challenging journey. I loved this last project and will be doing many more to perfect my skills as a developer. I was racking my brain this one. I had a lot to ups and downs but this one taught me to really appreciate the little wins. I feel much confinent in myself as a developer, but I still want to learn and perfect many more languages. React is a really powerful language, I loved this whole course and am ready to tackle another challenge. For this last project I created something that I am super passionate about, which is football. I love everthing about, so I developed a scouting app where you are able to add your favorite players and some attributes of theirs. And create a list of players you admire and or if you were a scout add them to your team. This was an amazing journey.
