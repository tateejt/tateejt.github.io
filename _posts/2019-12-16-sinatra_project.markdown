This project was a challenge for me, I ran into many errors and trials. I am running on Windows OS so the gem shotgun was not working for starters in my terminal. Lucky I got help and realized I can run my project in the sandbox in Learn.co. That was a lifesaver, I spent hours trying to figure out what I could do next to run my project but nothing was working. I would say that was my biggest downfall. This project was super challenging and frustrating. But I eventually came through and used all my knowledge of what I have learned in this course. I know that there is going to be more challenging projects going forward and I am ready to tackle this head on. My Bookshelf is also something that I could use moving forward when I finish books or buy books I can add them to my new app.
