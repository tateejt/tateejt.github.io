A hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted. Hashes can be easily created using their implicit form, example: 

***football_players = { "Cam Newton" => 1, "Christian McCafferey" => 22}***

This is an example of a hash and how one would be created. Hashes are good for being used as a way to represent data structures. Also, to have named parameters in functions. There are many different uses for hashes, depending on what you decide to use them for. 

 There are many different resourses out there to help learn all the different ways you can use hashes.
